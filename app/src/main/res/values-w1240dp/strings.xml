Accepting the feeling without trying to explain it can sometimes be helpful. Take yourself out of the situation. You could go for a walk, go to a different room or log off if the situation is online. Use a code word for when you feel angry. You could say this to others or to yourself to signal that you need some time to yourself before talking any further. This may help you avoid having to explain yourself in the moment. Focus on what\'s around you. Try listing 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell and 1 thing you can taste. Focus on your breath. Breathe slowly and deeply. Try breathing in through your nose and out through your mouth. Some people find it helpful to count while doing this. Use a grounding object. Keep a small object with you to hold and focus on when you feel angry. For example, you could use a marble, a fidget toy or a piece of fabric. Keep notes on your phone with reminders to yourself about what to do when you feel angry.</string>
